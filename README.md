# ios-challenge
Welcome to the iOS-Challenge. This is supposed to be a pair-programming session where you will lead the coding and you'll have a SmileDirectClub Engineer to follow you. This is NOT the ultimate test, is a pair programming experience, so please share your thoughts, ask questions/advice and use google extensively if you need to.

## Requirements
Build an iOS application that retrieves the popular videos from the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/) and show a playable list of them on the screen (the shown video needs to be the highest available resolution).

We are not looking for a super fancy UI nor the best code architeture in the world, just try to get the problem done in the given time frame. We also don't expect you to finish everything but we'll give you extra credits for it.
